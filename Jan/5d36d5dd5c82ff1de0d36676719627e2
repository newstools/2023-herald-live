Conflicting reports that the escaped tiger in Edenvale has been captured have emerged. Gary Wilson of Swat SOS told media in the Eastleigh Ridge suburb  the tiger was safely darted a short while ago. However, Edenvale SPCA inspector Hope Mokalapa said they have no proof the tiger was  darted. The animal welfare organisation said in a statement at 11.12am: “We cannot confirm any reports as we have not seen the tiger nor heard from authorities as to whether she is safe and where she has been moved to. More information will be given when we have it but no confirmation can be given on any reports of her being safely captured.” The  suburb was  panicked early on Monday by  news that an adolescent tiger had escaped from  a  property in the area. The young tiger was spotted at about 5.20am on CCTV footage shared by Swat SOS. Information about the owner and the property  where the  exotic big cat was kept remain sketchy. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
