Disgruntled Nkandla residents on Monday brought the small KwaZulu-Natal town to a standstill as they demanded  tar roads,  saying they are tired of empty promises. Residents blocked the P61/2, P50, P90, P16 and P707 using rocks and burning tyres. They claimed they are unable to drive their vehicles around after heavy rain and the vehicles  are damaged when they get stuck in  mud. Residents said  for years they had been trying to engage the municipality and  the provincial department of transport. They  were not getting anywhere with  the municipality and the department who  cited  a  lack of funds  to fix the roads. Mayor Mbhekiseni Biyela confirmed  residents were protesting and said according to  information  the protest will continue. Biyela said on Sunday the municipality  and the department met residents to  find a way forward. The meeting did not go according to plan and  collapsed after residents demanded a plan and timeline. Community members then decided to  protest. “Resident demanded that the department provide them with the exact timeline of when the road construction will start. After that was not done, residents warned  they  would bring the town to a standstill. In 2021, the department promised to build the roads and  said it had a budget in place, but that was not done. They have been protesting  since the morning and a lot of people are unable to get to work.” Biyela said the state of roads in many areas  in the municipality was depressing. He tried to engage  resident but they refused to back down,  saying they will only be moved by contractors  coming to build a road. “I understand  the department may not have the project as we speak. However, I am hopeful that during the upcoming budget allocation the department will remember the outcry of Nkandla residents,” added Biyela. TimesLIVE
