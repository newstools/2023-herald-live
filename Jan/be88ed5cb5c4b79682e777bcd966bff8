Police are  searching for at least five  people who hijacked  a truck carrying  about R2m worth of catalytic converters. The incident  occurred at about 6pm on Friday  when a truck was transporting the valuable  car parts from  Kariega to a business in Markman on the outskirts of Gqeberha. There have been  several attacks on trucks carrying catalytic converters worth millions of rand in recent months. Initial police reports indicate that the truck was approached by the occupants of a white bakkie on the M17 heading towards Markman  on Friday. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said five men  allegedly climbed out of the bakkie and pointed firearms at the 53-year-old truck driver. “The driver was removed from the truck and loaded into the bakkie with some of the suspects,” he said. “The remaining suspects took the truck and drive off in a different direction.” The bakkie drove around for an unknown period of time before the truck driver was dropped off in Ikamvelihle, where he  reported the incident at the police station. Beetge said the incident had then been reported to the Swartkops police station as the incident had occurred in  that area. Members of the police’s dog unit, in collaboration with a vehicle tracking firm, recovered the truck on the Kuduskloof road at about 10pm on Friday. The  entire cargo had been removed. According to private security operatives close to the investigation, there are indications that the vehicle’s tracking system was disabled with a jamming device, delaying the  recovery of the vehicle until the cargo was removed. The investigation has been handed over to a team specialising in truck hijackings at the provincial serious violent crimes unit. The police urged  anyone with information about the incident to contact Constable Zukisa Busakwe on 082-442-0895,  Crime Stop on 08600-10111 or the nearest police station. HeraldLIVE
