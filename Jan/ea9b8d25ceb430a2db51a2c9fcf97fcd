Eskom’s  load-shedding cut ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula’s energy crisis speech, leaving him in an awkward and ironic situation. Mbalula was delivering the keynote address at the ANC’s emergency energy dialogue on how the ruling intended to deal with load-shedding According to the party, the aim of the dialogue was to create a broader platform for all those in the energy field to meet and talk about the energy  crisis the country is  facing. “We engage robustly in ideas. It was sometimes not a nice debate because they took to the streets,”  Mbalula said before being cut off by load-shedding. Outgoing ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe told media the party was aware  load-shedding  would interrupt the dialogue. “We can’t suspend convening events because we have load-shedding issues. We have  to talk about this, whether it happens in the dark or during light. We’ll have to do that. It is important,” said Mabe. “The ANC cannot move away from attending to problems of the people because there is load-shedding. What you saw is the real picture all  South Africans are exposed to  daily. “The incident is  confirmation and testimony  the ANC is not exonerated. We go through this ourselves.”
