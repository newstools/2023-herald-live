Two people died in a head-on collision on the N2 on Friday morning near the Gamtoos River. At about 9.30am, just before the river,  a Land Cruiser was travelling from Jeffreys Bay towards Gqeberha with two occupants. A Nissan Hardbody bakkie was travelling in the opposite direction, with the driver the only occupant. It is alleged that the Land Cruiser was overtaking a vehicle and while travelling on the wrong side of the road it collided with the Nissan bakkie. The Land Cruiser’s female driver, aged 22, and a male passenger, 39, died on the scene. The 43-year-old driver of the Nissan bakkie sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital. Thornhill detectives are investigating a case of culpable homicide. HeraldLIVE
