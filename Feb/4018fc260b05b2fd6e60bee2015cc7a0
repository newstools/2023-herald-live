Finance minister Enoch Godongwana has warned  he will have no choice but to increase taxes if he’s forced to introduce a basic income grant. Godongwana  was speaking at a pre-budget briefing in Cape Town  tabling  the 2023/2024 budget in parliament on Wednesday. “I’m not raising taxes this year but next year is a different ball game. I’ll raise taxes for different reasons; there’s always a warning which we did in February last year, we’re repeating that warning. “For argument's sake, let’s say we want to increase the R350 social relief of distress (SRD) grant or improve it and make it a basic income grant … you must also know  you’re calling for me to tax you more.” Godongwana has long been under pressure from civil society formations and ANC tripartite alliance partners to  convert the  SRD grant to an improved permanent basic income grant. The SRD grant was introduced in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19  lockdown to cushion the poor and  unemployed from the economic impact of the  pandemic. Godongwana told MPs  he has set aside R36bn  to extend the payment of the   SRD grant to March 2024. “In 2023/2024, R35.7bn  is allocated to the South African Social Security Agency to administer it. Government is still considering alternative options to provide appropriate social protection for the working age population that can replace or complement the  grant. “Funds spend on the grant are lower than projected in 2022/2023 due to improved means testing,” said Godongwana in  budget documents tabled in parliament on Wednesday. He also increased other social grants by  5%. This will see the child support grant rising from R480  to R505 per month. Old age and disability grants have been raised from R1,985  to R2,085 per month. The child support and old age grants account for 70%  of government’s  spending on social grants, which is due to reach R284bn  by 2026. “These two grants will be provided to  17.5-million beneficiaries in 2023/2024. Social grants will increase in line with inflation over the medium-term.” TimesLIVE
