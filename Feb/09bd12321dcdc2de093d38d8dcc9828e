The case against Sifiso Mkhwanazi, accused of the murder of an alleged sex worker in downtown Johannesburg, has been postponed for further investigations. Mkhwanazi briefly appeared at the Johannesburg magistrate's court on Monday. The 20-year-old was arrested after the discovery of six women’s bodies in a panel-beating business in central Johannesburg in October 2022. He was charged with one murder  while investigators pursue inquiries into the deaths of the other five women. The case was postponed to April 25 after the state asked the court for the delay  due to outstanding DNA results and CCTV footage. The court heard  four of the six bodies have  been positively identified and the DNA of the other two is outstanding. State prosecutor Tshepo Mahange Ka Mzizi also told the court they hoped to comb through CCTV footage of the crime scene building from three months before  the latest murder in an attempt to ascertain when and how the other women had entered the premises. Mkhwanazi was remanded in custody. TimesLIVE
