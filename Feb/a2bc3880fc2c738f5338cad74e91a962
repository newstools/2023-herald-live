The Johannesburg high court  reprimanded Andre Gerhard Ackerman on Thursday for an outburst as a police officer was testifying. Ackerman is accused of a raft of charges including sexually exploiting young boys and  distributing child porn. He has pleaded not guilty. W/O Hendrik du Plessis from the serial and electronic crime investigation unit  was on the stand on Thursday. He testified that a minor from the Free State had arrived in Johannesburg to  live with Ackerman, who ran a massage parlour. The minor alleged he fell asleep on a bed during a massage lesson by Ackerman  and woke up to find Ackerman performing oral sex on him. To this, Ackerman retorted “bulls**t”. Prosecutor  Valencia Dube complained to the judge that Ackerman was interjecting while the witness was testifying. Judge Ismael Mohamed told Ackerman: “One more outburst like this, then you will sit downstairs and the trial will go on in your absence.” Mohamed said if Ackerman had anything to say he should lift his hand. Interjections would not be tolerated. “This is not a shebeen,” the judge said. TimesLIVE
