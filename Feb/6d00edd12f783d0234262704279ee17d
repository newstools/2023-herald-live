International financial crime watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday said it was adding South Africa  and Nigeria to its so-called grey list of countries under special scrutiny to implement standards to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. The FATF is an intergovernmental organisation that underpins the fight against money-laundering and terrorism financing by setting global standards and checking if countries respect them. Reuters
