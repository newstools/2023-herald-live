ANC chief whip Pemmy Majodina wants murder-accused MP Sibusiso Kula to be recalled from parliament. Majodina told journalists that she has written to the party’s national executive committee recommending that Kula be removed from his parliamentary seat. This would be on top of Kula having to “step aside” as an ANC representative. The ANC’s “step-aside” policy requires members charged with serious crimes to recuse themselves within 30 days or be forcefully removed. “According to our constitution, rule 25, public representatives must face the national executive committee when they do something wrong,” said Majodina. “I’ve written a report about him and made a clear proposal for him to step aside, we are implementing that, and for him to be processed to the NDC (national disciplinary committee).” Majodina said due to the gravity of the offence Kula is accused of — gender-based violence and femicide — she further recommended that the party recall him from parliament. “We cannot allow such allegations against an MP,” she said. Kula faces a charge of murdering his wife Jennifer Motlhomi on November 27, in what initially appeared like a robbery. The National Prosecuting Authority said Motlhomi had a stab wound on her back, but the object used for her murder has not been recovered. “The matter was reported by the medical facility where she was allegedly transported by the accused to receive medical attention. He told the police that he was not at home when the incident occurred,” said the NPA. It said after thorough police investigations, Kula was linked to the alleged murder. He was arrested on January 20 and charged with murder. He remains in police custody after the Orkney magistrate’s court denied him bail at his last appearance on January 31. TimesLIVE
