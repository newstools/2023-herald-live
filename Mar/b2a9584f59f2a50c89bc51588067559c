A 33-year-old man has been sentenced to a fine of R12,300 after pleading guilty to contravening the Counterfeit Goods and Trademark Act. Haseeb Ali was convicted and sentenced in the Gqeberha magistrate's court during his first appearance on Monday. Meanwhile, the charges against his co-accused Mudassar Bashir and Haddikumar Patel, both 33, were withdrawn.
