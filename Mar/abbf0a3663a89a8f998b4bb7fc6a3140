ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba has weighed in on former deputy president David Mabuza keeping his salary and other perks after resigning. New24 reported Mabuza will keep his R3m salary, VIP protection and other perks despite not finishing his term. “Unbelievable. This is happening in a country in which 54% of its citizens live below the bread line,” said Mashaba. “We need a report from parliament to give us as taxpayers a sense of this individual’s contribution towards all these perks.” Mabuza tendered his resignation as a MP last week, ending his term as  second-in-command. TimesLIVE Premium reported  Mabuza sent his letter of resignation to the speaker of the National Assembly on Tuesday. ANC National Assembly chief whip Pemmy Majodina confirmed his resignation, saying: “Yes, he resigned yesterday [Tuesday]. The letter came to me and speaker as per the rule.” Briefing the media in Pretoria, minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele said the cabinet thanked Mabuza for his “exceptional service” over the past five years. “Deputy president Mabuza served with distinction, and his contribution in building the country we want will forever be remembered by the people of South Africa,” said Gungubele. “Deputy president David Mabuza had been allocated tasks by the president, whether it was on HIV, transforming traditional leadership or rural development or the Eskom task team. All those matters in terms of the records in front of the president, the deputy president did carry [out his duties].” He said Ramaphosa was not surprised by Mabuza’s resignation. “The president spoke about this in public, that the deputy president had expressed his contemplation to leave, but he agreed to have him wait a little bit. He has acted in line with his agreement with the president. I want to believe that.”
