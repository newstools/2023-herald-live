Five men accused of robbing a German tourist on a hiking trail in Hout Bay, nearly three weeks ago appeared in court on Monday, but the whereabouts of Nick Frischke is still unknown. An extensive search has yielded no trace of the missing 22-year-old, but some of his personal belongings, including a credit card, backpack and cellphone, were allegedly found among items of stolen property recovered by police. A knife was also found. Ishaan Fisher, Jason Adonis, Melvin Geunantin, Petersen van Roy and Carlo Geunantin appeared in the Wynberg magistrate’s court. The Hout Bay Community Policing Forum said on February 28  three suspects  initially arrested had allegedly “admitted to robbing  Frischke”, but despite extensive questioning at the time there were no leads on the whereabouts of Frischke. Frischke was last seen in a shop at the V&A Waterfront on February 14. The tourist had arrived in  South Africa eight days earlier and had booked into an Airbnb  in Pinelands. The court postponed the case to May 4 for further investigation. Western Cape National Prosecuting Authority  spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said  some of the suspects also faced  unrelated robbery cases. “The court was told  there is a further investigation that still needs to be done which includes taking of witness statements, DNA and analysis of cellphone material. “We  understand  some of the accused  face other charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances. The court  ordered that their names can be published but their faces cannot be published as there is still an identity parade that has to be done.” TimesLIVE
