Another petrol price increase awaits motorists next month, but the price of diesel is expected to drop. According to mid-month data from the Central Energy Fund (CEF), the prices of both 93 and 95 unleaded petrol are expected to rise 35c/l on April 5. The price of high-sulphur 0.05% diesel is expected to decrease 9c/l, with an 11c reduction for low-sulphur 0.005% diesel. The price of illuminating paraffin should decrease by 53c. This is preliminary data based on the current oil price and rand-dollar exchange rate, but could change before month end, said the CEF. The year started on a good note with price cuts of more than R2/lÂ for petrol and diesel in January. However, in February and March motorists were hit with hikes. In Gauteng the following prices per litre  apply: 95 ULP: R22.95 93 ULP: R22.65 Diesel 500ppm: R21.62 Diesel 50ppm: R21.72
