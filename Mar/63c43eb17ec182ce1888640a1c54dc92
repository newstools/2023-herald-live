For the first time, Centrestage will step into the current decade of pop classics with their  new show, titled Belting Babes and Funky Dudes, at the Music Kitchen on Friday. In a tribute to powerhouse icons headlining today’s stages, the show pays homage to explosive chart-topping artists P!nk, Meghan Trainor, Bruno Mars and Pitbull. Centrestage superstar Tara-Jane Stern fronts the Belting Babes, supported by exciting Centrestage newcomer singers and dancers Cailan van Heerden and Tiffany East. Van Heerden is a familiar face to theatres around Gqeberha, having performed in many Gilbert & Sullivan  cabarets and played the lead role of Mimi for Rent The Musical. East is  a powerful vocalist with a commanding stage presence who made her theatre debut in the cabaret, The Alternative, performing her own original music. Van Heerden and East have both seen success from their recent cabaret show, Paradox of Love by The Collective — founded by Van Heerden. Thuba Myeki ascends new heights as he embraces Bruno Mars and sizzles as Pitbull, tackling the funky smooth stylings and fast-paced lyrics with  aplomb. Top choreographer and spectacular dancer Tilette Roelofse is the fifth member of the dynamic cast. Stern and Myeki received critical acclaim for their roles in Centrestage’s recent hit show, The Songs That Rocked our World. The musical selection is Centrestage’s most contemporary to date. Trainor’s fun, upbeat pop with a retro vibe features nostalgic elements of doo-wop, while P!nk’s anthemic sound is characterised by powerful vocals and empowering lyrics. Bruno Mars has been influential in the revival of funk and R&B sounds, also incorporating throwback elements. Pitbull is known for his energetic, festive, Latin dance-pop stylings. Current charting songs by the likes of Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Lizzo are also included in this musical celebration. Tickets cost R160 and are available through Quicket. The show starts at 7.30pm. HeraldLIVE
