Police  have arrested a 21-year-old father from  Middelplaas, outside Malelane, Mpumalanga, after he allegedly slit  his three-week-old son's throat on Wednesday. The  body of the infant was found  wrapped  in a bloodied blanket and  towel dumped in bushes near a water reservoir and diesel depot in Middelplaas,  police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala said. The man has been  charged with kidnapping, murder and defeating the ends of justice. It is alleged  he  was in the company of  four friends when he forcefully snatched the baby  from  the 15-year-old mother. Mohlala said the  mother and her family did  not  immediately report the incident to  police but conducted their own  search instead. As  dawn broke with no sign of the father and  child,  they reported the matter to Schoemansdal SAPS on Thursday. “Police  launched a manhunt with the aim of reuniting the little boy with his mother [but] information was received that the  body of the child was found dumped in  bushes,” he said. Information was received that the suspect was at his uncle's  home at Kamaqhekeza outside Komatipoort. He had reportedly arrived there  with a bag full of clothes. “Schoemansdal police  followed up. The suspect was found in his uncle's house on  Thursday  and  was arrested.” Mohlala said  because of the age of the child's mother a statutory rape charge will be added. The man is expected to appear in the Nkomazi magistrate's court in Tonga soon. Mpumalanga acting  police commissioner Maj-Gen  Zeph Mkhwanazi  condemned the crime. He described it  as inhumane behaviour and called for  justice for the infant. He  advised the public to immediately  contact police when there is suspicion of someone's life being in danger.
