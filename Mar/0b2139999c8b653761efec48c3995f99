The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) has  issued a list of 11 demands it wants met  before the planned “national shutdown” on March 20. The  federation will join the EFF  in its  “mother of national shutdowns” against load-shedding and other service delivery issues. “Food and transport have become more expensive. If you loan money you must pay it back at higher rates. Meanwhile, workers’ wage[s] have been declining while bosses' profit have increased. “The are  more than 11-million unemployed people in  South Africa. To live, the unemployed and lowest paid workers must received [a] basic income grant of R1,500 and a job guarantee scheme,” Saftu said. Saftu's demands are: Saftu  general-secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said the union had agreed to participate after the EFF  requested it. “This means we will galvanise and mobilise our members to join the national shutdown across the country,” Vavi said. The federation would  ensure  workers who participate would be protected. “We have submitted [a] section 77 notice to Nedlac to protect  workers in and outside the federation. This means any worker, even if they are not members of unions affiliated to Saftu, will be protected from victimisation by employers.” Vavi said the EFF’s demands would also have to highlight working-class challenges and include socioeconomic challenges. “Saftu’s principal demands include the creation of decent jobs by rebuilding our manufacturing base through re-industrialisation, addressing the escalating cost of living by  not only restructuring the economy, but the introduction of the universal basic income grant, increasing the minimum wage to a living wage, combating crime and gender-based violence and ending load-shedding,” he said.
